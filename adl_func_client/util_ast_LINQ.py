def parse_as_ast (ast_source: Union[str,ast.AST]) -> ast.Lambda:
    r'''Return an AST for a lambda function from several sources.
    
    We are handed one of several things:
        - An AST that is a lambda function
        - An AST that is a pointer to a Module that wraps an AST
        - Text that contains properly formatted ast code for a lambda function.

    In all cases, return a lambda function as an AST starting from the AST top node,
    and one where calls to Select, SelectMany, etc., have been replaced with proper
    AST nodes.

    Args:
        ast_source:     An AST or text string that represnets the lambda.

    Returns:
        An ast starting from the Lambda AST node.

    A python 3 AST tranformer to replace function calls in the AST that are actually LINQ operators.

    ObjectStream has methods called Select and SelectMany. When they are called, they build up the AST tree. But they do that
    by creating Select and SelectMany, etc., ast nodes. When we parse a lambda passed as text, that does not happen. This
    NodeTransformer does that replacement in-place.
